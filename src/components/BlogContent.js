    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 mt-16'>If you’ve done even any basic reading on diet and nutrition, you’d have read all about the importance of different proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. But today, our <span className='font-bold'>Nutrition Expert, Chandni Haldurai</span> is here to talk about a nutrient that’s not discussed nearly as much - creatine.</p>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>So, let’s get right into it.</p>

    <h2 className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6 text-3xl font-bold'>What is creatine?</h2>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>Creatine is one of  the body’s natural sources for energy needed for muscle contraction.The natural substance turns into creatine phosphate body, which in turn helps make a substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides the energy for muscle contractions.</p>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>While the body produces some of the creatine it uses, maintaining an optimal level will require you to consume protein-rich foods such as meat or fish. In a normal omnivorous /carnivorous diet, you consume one to two grams/day of creatine. Vegetarians, therefore,  may have lower amounts of creatine in their bodies. On the other hand, though, since  vegetarians have lower intramuscular creatine storage, they may see greater gains from taking the supplements. However, it may take longer to build up levels in the muscles.</p>

    <h2 className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6 text-3xl font-bold'>How much creatine should I consume?</h2>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>A person needs between 1 and 3 grams of creatine a day. Around half of this comes from the diet, and the rest is synthesized by the body. Food sources include red meat and fish. One pound of raw beef or salmon provides 1 to 2 grams  of creatine.</p>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), larger athletes who train intensely “may need to consume between 5 and 10 grams of creatine a day” to maintain their stores. People who cannot synthesize creatine because of a health condition may need to take 10 to 30 grams a day to avoid health problems. </p>

    <h2 className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6 text-3xl font-bold'>Summing Up</h2>
    <p className='w-1/2 mx-36 my-6'>A well-rounded approach to health and an optimal diet includes awareness of nutrition - what to consume and how much. Creatine is an essential part of an individual’s diet, whether they are athletes or not - and when taken in the right amounts, can improve your strength, muscle recovery, and overall well being. Just remember to consult a qualified dietician before you make any drastic changes to your diet!</p>
